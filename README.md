# Project 1 - Deterministic Finite Automata

* Authors: Julia Melchert and Axel Murillo
* Class: CS361 Section 002
* Semester: Spring 2024

## Overview

This project uses Java to mimic a deterministic finite automaton (DFA).

## Reflection

We were able to decipher the given skeleton code well and quickly begin working
on the project. Our conceptual knowledge of DFAs really helped us complete it. 
However, our team struggled to work together with differing schedules and lacking
communication, so that made it difficult to complete the project together. 
However, near the end, we decided on how to split the work to suit our
skills and time remaining best, and ended up finishing the project well.



We used the original project's structure to our advantage in order to break
functions up and choose data types wisely. For instance, having our transitions
represented as a hashmap with the states as the keys and a hashmap as the values 
allowed us to easily see which states had what transitions and on what characters. 
This was easy to print out to the console for debugging and verification, too.

Write a brief (2-3 paragraph) reflection describing your experience with this 
project. Answer the following questions (but feel free to add other insights): 
- What worked well and what was a struggle?
- What concepts still aren't quite clear?
- What techniques did you use to make your code easy to debug and modify?
- What would you change about your design process?
- If you could go back in time, what would you tell yourself about doing this project?

## Compiling and Using

This section should tell the user how to compile your code.  It is
also appropriate to instruct the user how to use your code. Does your
program require user input? If so, what does your user need to know
about it to use it as quickly as possible?

## Sources used

If you used any sources outside of the lecture notes, class lab files,
or text book you need to list them here. If you looked something up on
stackoverflow.com and fail to cite it in this section it will be
considered plagiarism and be dealt with accordingly. So be safe CITE!
